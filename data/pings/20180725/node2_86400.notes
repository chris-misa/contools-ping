command:
  /local/repository/iputils/ping -i 0.5 -c 86400 node2

  Ran for 12 hours.

  Data seems to be bi-modal with peaks around 0.12 and 0.15 seconds.
  Sub sequences of data (ca 100 points) are also bi-modal making it seem
  this is part of the actual distribution not an artifact of some mid-process
  change in conditions.

  Need to follow up on this with varying time interval.
